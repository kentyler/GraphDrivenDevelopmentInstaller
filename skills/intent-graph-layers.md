# Intent Graph Layers

The layer definitions for the GDD intent graph. These JSON blocks are the graph's starting state -- insert them during bootstrap (see `intent-graph.md`, Build Order, step 3).

Read `intent-graph.md` first for the model, vocabulary, and conventions.

**Build discipline: verify before proceeding.** Layers are thematic groupings; build order follows `blocked-by` edges, not layer numbers. But within a build step, do not move to the next operation until the current one passes its test condition. The `blocked-by` edges encode this structurally — an intent whose dependencies are not green is not workable. During the first build, enforce this manually: run the test, confirm it passes, then proceed. See `intent-graph.md` (Build by dependency-stable layers) for the gated sequence.

### Layer -1: System Origins (separate file)

Founding decisions (PostgreSQL, Express, MCP SDK, etc.) inscribed as already-green intent/expression pairs. See `system-origins.md` for the full account and insertion script.

### Layer 0: Foundation -- Schema and Core Types

Note: The two core graph tables (nodes, edges) and the graph_memberships join table carry no temporal metadata -- no `created_at`, no `created_by`. The graph's history is its topology (supersession chains, closed gaps, satisfies edges from expression nodes), not timestamps. The graphs table carries `created_at` as administrative metadata (when the graph identity was established). The three operational tables (agents, skills, llm_providers) also carry `created_at` -- these are configuration and registry tables, not graph elements, and their creation time is useful administrative metadata that does not contradict the graph's write-only semantics.

### Layer 5: Human Surfaces

The system serves multiple actor types, but humans need surfaces -- places where the graph becomes legible and actionable without requiring direct graph operations. These intents describe what humans need to see and do, not how it looks. The building LLM chooses the implementation: web UI, CLI, terminal dashboard, or any other form that satisfies the behavioral test conditions.

**Two surface families with different delivery mechanisms.** Admin surfaces (dashboard, intent detail, gap surface) are served by the backend directly -- they are part of the same Express application, served as static files from `public/`, and call the REST API. They are for direct graph actors: power users, operators, and administrators who work against the graph intentionally. User-facing surfaces (client intake) are external MCP clients -- they connect through the MCP server (Layer 6), enabling actors who work inside external tools (Claude Desktop, Excel, Word, Slack) to reach the graph without leaving their environment. The backend does not serve user-facing surfaces.

### Resolved Decisions

These were originally gaps, now resolved:

**Graph element construction: Explicit.** LLMs emit graph operations (createIntent, createEdge, createGap, createDecision) as primary output. There is no observer/derivation layer. Derivation contradicts the completeness model -- it introduces a lag between conversation and graph state.

**Intent supersession: Write-only.** When an intent is no longer intended, it is superseded by a new intent via a `supersedes` edge. The old intent remains in the graph as history. No removal, no deletion. Downstream dependents turn red if their dependency structure is affected -- the red/green mechanism surfaces the impact naturally. History lives in the graph topology, not in a separate log.
