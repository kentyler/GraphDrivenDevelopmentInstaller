# System Origins

This skill file defines **Layer -1**: the founding intents that precede the graph itself. These intents record the decisions made before any graph operation was possible — substrate choice, runtime environment, protocol selection, configuration strategy, and the axiomatic founding moment.

Read `intent-graph.md` and `foundations.md` first.

## Why this layer exists

The self-hosting proof in `foundations.md` says: the graph must be able to represent the construction of everything it tracks. `gdd-root` acknowledges the founding moment philosophically. Layer -1 completes the proof operationally: it inscribes the pre-graph decisions into the graph in the same vocabulary used for everything else.

Without Layer -1, the system's substrate choice (PostgreSQL) lives only in prose in `intent-graph.md`. That prose is outside the graph's reasoning machinery — it cannot be queried, superseded through normal graph operations, or discovered by an actor asking "why does the system use this database?" Layer -1 makes those decisions first-class graph citizens.

**Note (built system):** Layer -1 nodes are fully inscribed in the built graph. All 6 intent/expression pairs exist with satisfies edges (arriving already green), the system-origins compose node contains all 6, and gdd-root contains system-origins. The founding decisions are first-class graph citizens -- queryable, legible, and supersedeable through normal graph operations.

## Key property: nodes arrive already green

Every node in this layer is inserted already satisfied. The intent node and its expression node are inserted together, with the `satisfies` edge already present. No actor ever works these intents. They are historical record, not work queue.

This is the same posture as `gdd-root` — a founding moment inserted by the bootstrap script directly, outside the normal graph mechanism. The difference is that `gdd-root` is a single philosophical anchor; Layer -1 is the set of concrete decisions that surround it.

## The supersession contract

The point of inscribing these decisions is to make them supersedeable. When the time comes to change the substrate — or any other founding decision — the operation is:

1. Create a new intent (if the abstract intent itself is being refined) or skip to step 2
2. Create a new expression node recording the new choice
3. Add a `satisfies` edge from the new expression to the abstract intent
4. Supersede the old expression node via a `supersedes` edge (new → old)

The abstract intent stays green throughout. Downstream intents that are `blocked-by` the abstract intent are unaffected — they depend on the intent, not on the specific expression. The supersession chain records what changed and why. The substrate swap is a graph event with full provenance.

## Compose node

Add `system-origins` as a child of `gdd-root`. Its test condition is structural: all children green. Since all children arrive already green, `system-origins` is green from the moment of insertion — it does not change the bootstrap sequence or add any red work.

Update `gdd-root`'s children array (in `intent-graph-layers.md`) to include `"system-origins"` alongside the existing seven children.

## Bootstrap insertion sequence

In the bootstrap script, insert Layer -1 **after** creating the schema and tables but **before** inserting `gdd-root` and the Layer 0-7 intents. The order within the bootstrap script:

```
1. CREATE SCHEMA gdd (if not exists)
2. CREATE TABLE gdd.nodes, gdd.edges, gdd.graphs, gdd.graph_memberships, gdd.agents, gdd.skills, gdd.llm_providers (if not exists)
3. CREATE TYPE enums (if not exists)
4. INSERT system-origins compose node
5. INSERT all six Layer -1 intent nodes
6. INSERT all six Layer -1 expression nodes
7. INSERT all six satisfies edges (expression → intent)
8. INSERT contains edges (system-origins → each intent node)
9. INSERT gdd-root (with system-origins as an additional child)
10. INSERT Layer 0-7 nodes and edges
11. INSERT contains edge (gdd-root → system-origins)
```

All inserts use `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` for idempotency.

## Superseding a founding decision

When a founding decision changes — substrate migration, runtime change, protocol upgrade — the operation is:

```
1. Create new expression node (e.g. persist-graph-state-neo4j)
   with artifacts describing the new choice
2. INSERT satisfies edge: new-expression → persist-graph-state
3. INSERT supersedes edge: new-expression → old-expression
```

The abstract intent (`persist-graph-state`) remains green throughout. Its test condition remains the same — the substrate must survive restarts, regardless of which substrate. The downstream intents (`foundation-tables`, etc.) that are `blocked-by` `persist-graph-state` are unaffected.

If the abstract intent itself needs revision — if "persists graph state reliably" turns out to be the wrong framing — supersede the intent node the same way any intent is superseded: new intent node + `supersedes` edge.
