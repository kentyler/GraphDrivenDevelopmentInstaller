# Status note

This skill file describes completeness in the current reference expression. Read it alongside the newer distinction between satisfaction and readability.

Satisfaction asks whether an expression passes a test. Readability asks whether an inscription can currently be interpreted as a meaningful move within a board. A node may be green but unreadable, red but readable, untested but readable, or readable only later.

# Graph Completeness Model

**This is the decision log that produced the current spec.** The decisions below have been applied to `intent-graph.md` and `intent-graph-layers.md`. Operation names referenced in the "Impact on Existing Code" section (e.g., `computeTension`, `queryActive`, `recomputeStatus`, `applyCommit`) refer to an earlier design and no longer exist in the current spec. This document is retained as the reasoning record -- the authoritative spec is `intent-graph.md`.

Resolves `gap-tension-derivation`. Emerged from discussion on 2026-04-15.

## Core Principle: The Accumulated Plans

The graph is not the house -- it is the accumulated set of plans. The house is projected from the plans. Every plan ever drawn remains in the set, but superseded plans are marked as such. The current house is derived from the plans that have not been superseded.

Intents come into existence *with* their expression. There may be a brief transient moment (construction), but the graph does not enter a special waiting state. It assumes all intents are intended to be expressed. The graph is write-only -- intents are never removed or modified, only superseded.

## Decisions

### 1. Tension is dissolved

`computeTension` with weighted signals and priority scoring is the wrong abstraction. The graph doesn't need a mechanism to tell you what's urgent. It needs to tell you what's incomplete.

**What to do next** = intents without expressions. That's the only signal. No scores, no weights, no signal sources.

**Note (built system):** Tension was removed from intents but reappeared at the board level as an observational instrument. `gdd.tension_readings` records board-level tension -- how much unresolved structural stress a board carries. This is a separate concept from intent-level priority scoring: it measures the health of a boundary region, not the urgency of individual work items. The decision to dissolve intent-level tension stands; board-level tension is diagnostic, not prioritizing.

### 2. Red/Green (TDD at the architecture level)

The graph is a test suite:
- **Red**: intent exists, expression does not (or test condition is not satisfied)
- **Green**: intent exists, expression exists, test passes

"What to do next" = "what's red." The same red-green cycle as TDD, lifted to the intent graph.

Apply a commit, intents appear without expressions, graph goes red. Write the expressions, graph goes green. The red state is intentional and temporary — it's the working state, not an error to manage.

### 3. Test conditions are optional -- untested intents are a valid state

**Revised from original decision.** Test conditions are no longer mandatory on intent creation. An intent without a test condition is "untested" or "uncollapsed" -- it opens a possibility space that has not yet been made evaluable. It stays permanently red until a test is added and an expression satisfies it.

The test condition *is* the evaluable constraint. Name and description are human-friendly labels. The test condition is the verifiable claim: what must be true when this intent is satisfied. But recognition can precede evaluability -- the LLM may know something needs to exist before it can say what done looks like. This is different from a gap (where the blocker is more fundamental).

Following XP: no intent turns green without a test. The expression only needs to satisfy the test. It could be a literal string or a complex system. The simplest thing that passes. But creating the intent and writing its test are now independent reasoning acts that can happen in any order.

Similarly, expressions can be recorded without linking to intents -- an "unlinked" expression records production without claiming satisfaction. The LLM links it later via `linkExpression` when it has enough understanding to make that claim.

### 4. The Andon Cord

If any actor discovers a blocker or cannot articulate a test condition, that's diagnostic information -- the requirement isn't understood well enough, or something is incomplete at a specific location. The actor should:

- Create an **untested intent** if the need is clear but the test condition is not yet articulable
- Create a **gap node** if the blocker is more fundamental -- the intent itself cannot be named or scoped
- When the blocker is resolved, create a `decision` node with a `closes` edge to the gap, then create an expression node with a `satisfies` edge to the gap (artifacts reference the decision). The gap turns green through the normal mechanism.

The gap IS the incompleteness -- no actor attribution metadata is needed because the content carries the perspective. Decisions are the counterpart to gaps: an authored closure recording what was chosen, alternatives considered, and scope governed.

Intents are commitments (test defined). Gaps are detected blockers (test not possible yet). Decisions are authored closures (records what was chosen and why). Signals are environmental events (the thing already happened). Compose nodes are structural -- their test is "all children satisfied," not hand-written.

Six node kinds, six test condition rules:
- **Intent nodes**: test condition optional (when present, the verifiable claim; when absent, the intent is untested/uncollapsed)
- **Gap nodes**: no test condition (that's what makes them gaps -- they are blockers)
- **Decision nodes**: no test condition (they are deliberation nodes, not operational ones)
- **Signal nodes**: no test condition (the event already happened -- there is nothing to verify)
- **Expression nodes**: no test condition (they are artifacts, not requirements -- they carry `artifacts` JSONB instead)
- **Compose nodes**: structural test (all `contains` children are satisfied)

This replaces the old trust scoping rule that said clients can't create test conditions. Any actor that can state an intent can state what done looks like. If they can't state what done looks like, they don't have an intent -- they have a question.

### 5. The graph inscribes its own history

**Reversed from original decision.** Under write-only semantics, the graph IS its own history. There is no separate mutation log.

- A node no longer intended is **superseded** via a `supersedes` edge (new -> old), not removed
- History lives in the graph topology -- the `supersedes` edge chain IS the history
- The `supersedes` edge type is needed: it records what replaced what, and the chain is navigable
- Current intent is derived from supersession structure: a node with no `supersedes` edge pointing at it is current

### 6. Cascading redness (replaces cascading removal)

**Revised from original decision.** There is no removal. Superseding an upstream intent turns downstream dependents red -- their dependency structure has been affected. The red/green mechanism surfaces the impact naturally.

- Supersession does not cascade as deletion -- it cascades as redness
- Actors discover the impact through `queryIncomplete` and address it through the normal loop
- No two-phase confirmation, no agent thresholds for cascade size -- all unnecessary under supersession

### 7. Status removed

**Resolved.** The `potential` -> `active` -> `satisfied` lifecycle treated the graph like a task tracker. Under the house model, an intent is red (no incoming satisfies edge) or green (has an incoming satisfies edge from an expression node). This is derived from `satisfies` edges in `gdd.edges`, not stored as a status column or as fields on the node. There is no status enum, no `recomputeStatus` operation, and no expression columns on `gdd.nodes`. `blocked-by` is a structural constraint — workability is derived at query time by checking whether all dependencies have incoming satisfies edges.

### 8. Expressions are graph nodes

Expressions are first-class graph nodes (type `expression`), not rows in a subordinate `gdd.expressions` table. This enables many-to-many satisfaction: one expression node can satisfy multiple intents (via multiple `satisfies` edges), and one intent can be satisfied by multiple expression nodes. The old one-to-one model (`gdd.expressions` with `intent_id` FK) was too restrictive -- shared implementations, cross-cutting concerns, and collaborative expression all require many-to-many. Expression nodes carry an `artifacts` JSONB field and connect to intents via `satisfies` edges. They have no test condition and are neither red nor green.

### 9. Graph memberships replace graph_id

Nodes belong to graphs through `gdd.graph_memberships` (a join table), not through a `graph_id` column on `gdd.nodes`. This enables fragments as overlapping subgraphs: a node can appear in memberships for multiple graphs, serving as a shared boundary node. The old `graph_id` column forced each node into exactly one graph, making fragment overlap impossible without duplicating nodes. Shared boundary nodes are how graphs compose -- the boundary is structural, not a copy.

### 10. satisfies as first-class edge type

`satisfies` (expression -> intent) is the seventh edge type. It completes the expression-as-node model: an expression node connects to the intents it satisfies via `satisfies` edges. An intent with at least one incoming `satisfies` edge is green. This replaces the old derivation that checked for a row in `gdd.expressions`. The edge model makes many-to-many satisfaction natural and visible in the graph topology.

### 11. Edge supersession

Edges are structural claims -- "A depends on B", "X satisfies Y". Like intents, structural claims can be wrong. Under write-only semantics, wrong edges cannot be deleted. They must be supersedable.

Three columns added to `gdd.edges`: `description` (rationale for why this relationship exists), `created_by` (provenance), and `superseded_by` (points to the replacement edge, or null if current). `supersedeEdge` creates the replacement edge and sets `superseded_by` on the old one in a single operation. The replacement can change any field -- from_node, to_node, edge_type, description -- or keep some and revise others.

Projections filter to `superseded_by IS NULL`, so superseded edges are invisible in normal operation but remain in the graph as history. An LLM reading a projection sees only current edges, each with its description. When it discovers a wrong edge, it supersedes it -- the history of why the edge existed, who created it, and what replaced it is permanently legible.

This closes the structural evolution gap: nodes were already supersedable via `supersedes` edges, but edges themselves were implicit and irrevocable. Now the full graph topology -- nodes and edges -- supports write-only evolution.

### 12. Axiom as seventh node kind

Axioms are board-level constraints -- statements that govern how work proceeds within a board's scope. They are the seventh node kind alongside intent, gap, decision, signal, expression, and compose.

An axiom node:
- Requires `notes` and `board_id` (axioms are always board-scoped)
- Has no `test_condition` -- axioms are not testable claims but governing constraints
- Is excluded from `queryIncomplete` -- axioms are not work items and should never appear as "red"
- Is supersedable through the normal `supersedes` edge mechanism when a governing constraint changes
- Board boundaries are derived from axioms -- the `edge_statement` field (previously considered for boards) was removed in favor of axiom-based boundary definition

Seven node kinds, seven test condition rules:
- **Intent nodes**: test condition optional (verifiable claim when present; untested/uncollapsed when absent)
- **Gap nodes**: no test condition (that is what makes them gaps)
- **Decision nodes**: no test condition (deliberation, not operation)
- **Signal nodes**: no test condition (event already happened)
- **Expression nodes**: no test condition (artifacts, not requirements)
- **Compose nodes**: structural test (all `contains` children satisfied)
- **Axiom nodes**: no test condition (governing constraints, not testable claims)

## Impact on Existing Code

### Must change
- `createIntent`: accept optional `test_condition` for intent types (untested if null). Accept null for gaps, decisions, signals, expressions, compose. Expression nodes require `artifacts` JSONB.
- `recordExpression`: now creates an expression node + optional `satisfies` edge(s), accepts optional `intent_ids[]` (empty = unlinked expression). No longer inserts into `gdd.expressions` table.
- `queryIncomplete`: derive red/green from `satisfies` edges, not from `gdd.expressions`. Exclude expression nodes and axiom nodes from results.
- `buildProjection`: include expression nodes linked via `satisfies` edges. Accept optional `graph_id` for scoping via memberships. Filter out superseded edges (`superseded_by IS NULL`). Include edge descriptions in projections.
- `clientSession` LLM prompt: remove "clients cannot create test conditions"; instead instruct: create intent with test if clear, create gap if not
- `transduceExternal` LLM prompt: same routing -- intent with test or gap
- `translateToGraph` LLM prompt: include test_condition when articulable, create untested intent when not

### New operations
- `createGap`: convenience operation for creating gap nodes (notes required)
- `createDecision`: create decision nodes with optional `closes[]` array of gap IDs
- `supersedeIntent`: create `supersedes` edge (new -> old), mark old as superseded
- `linkExpression`: add `satisfies` edge from existing expression node to another intent
- `createGraph`: create a graph identity in `gdd.graphs`
- `addNodeToGraph`: create a membership in `gdd.graph_memberships`
- `removeNodeFromGraph`: delete a membership from `gdd.graph_memberships`
- `queryGraphNodes`: list nodes belonging to a graph via memberships
- `nodeGraphs`: list graphs a node belongs to via memberships
- `queryUnlinked`: list expression nodes with no `satisfies` edges (produced but unclaimed), optional board_id filter
- `setTestCondition`: set test_condition on an untested intent (write-once -- once set, immutable; to change, supersede the intent)
- `supersedeEdge`: create replacement edge and set `superseded_by` on old edge. Replacement inherits from/to/type from old unless overridden.

### Removed
- `removeIntent`: no removal under write-only semantics -- replaced by `supersedeIntent`
- `createSession`, `closeSession`, `sessionDiff`, `sessionHistory`: no sessions
- `sessionProjection`, `intersectGraphs`: no session-based projections
- Sessions table, mutations table: removed from schema
- **`gdd.expressions` table**: removed -- expressions are now nodes in `gdd.nodes` with `satisfies` edges
- Session status enum, actor type enum: removed
- `computeTension`, `queryActive`, `recomputeStatus`: replaced by `queryIncomplete`
- Status enum: removed -- red/green derived from satisfies edges

### Changed
- `createEdge`: now supports seven edge types (added `supersedes`, `closes`, `satisfies`). Accepts optional `description` and `created_by`.
- `supersedeIntent`: accepts optional `description` and `created_by` for the supersedes edge.
